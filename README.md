# Print My Day

Print My Day is a tool I made over-engineered to help me stay organised. A little bit of code pulls data from taskwarrior and my calendar, then sends it to my receipt printer on request.

This thing is great. It has encouraged me to keep on top of taskwarrior and my calendar, and check my phone and laptop less often.
